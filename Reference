To monitor this by: tail -f  $FWDIR/log/fwm.elg (even in R80.x).
When process is fully up a message like "Security Management server is alive" shows up. I think it was changed to CPM server started in R80.x. Then you know you were ready to go.



$MDS_FWDIR/scripts/cpm_status.sh
with results like
 
Check Point Security Management Server is running and ready

or

Check Point Security Management Server is during initialization



From a console or SSH run $CPMDIR/scripts/check_cpm_status.sh script.
When it shows CPM server started, you are good to go.
